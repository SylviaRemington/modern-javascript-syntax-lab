# Modern JavaScript Syntax Lab

## Introduction
- Over the last decade, JavaScript has seen significant changes in its syntax to make it more user-friendly, responding to developers’ needs. These updates have become standard in popular frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular.

- These changes primarily enhance coding efficiency rather than add new functionality to the language.

## Learning goals
- This lab is your opportunity to dive into modern JavaScript syntax. Understanding this contemporary style is beneficial, but a solid grasp of traditional JavaScript is essential. It lays a strong foundation not only for JavaScript but also for learning other programming languages. Remember, not all languages offer such syntax shortcuts.

- As a developer, you will encounter languages with unique characteristics, but many, including JavaScript, share foundational concepts. Mastering modern JavaScript syntax without relying on it as a crutch is crucial. This approach ensures you’re well-prepared to adapt to different programming languages without starting from scratch.

## Lab structure
Each Review section will briefly explain of a modern JavaScript concept, followed by an exercise to complete.

## The map() iterator method of arrays
- An array’s map() method returns a new array with the results of calling a function on every element in an existing array.

- Put another way, map() creates a new array where each element in the original array has been transformed by the action specified in the map() method’s callback function without altering the original array.

- map() returns a new array with altered values. It does not change the original array.
